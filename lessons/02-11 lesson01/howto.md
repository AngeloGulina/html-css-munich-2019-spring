# ReDI School ‚Äì HTML & CSS Intro Spring '19

## üìù Homework

#### ‚úÖ The steps to complete the home work are:

- Create a folder under the `lessons` folder for the lesson of Wednesday 13 February with the same format as the first lesson
- Create a file under this folder with file extension `.txt`
- Commit the changes from GitHub Desktop (also, save an history point of you changes)
      *note: you need to provide a _summary_ for it*
- Push the changes to your cloud


#### ‚úÖ In order to complete the homework, you need to have:

- A GitHub account. If you don't know how to create one, try to Google it or look [here](https://github.com/ReDI-School/html-css-munich-2018-fall/blob/master/github-account.md)
- A GitHub Desktop application. You can download following the guide [here](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop/)
- A copy of the original shared (*forked*) code (if you don't know what I'm talking about, go to the next list).
- Visual Studio Code. You can download the version for Windows or Mac from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## ü§î How can I copy the shared code for the class?

Once you have your GitHub account and the GitHub Account Desktop, you will be able to copy the shared code for the class.

Copying the code, in GitHub terms, is called **Fork**.

In order to do it
- go [here](https://github.com/ReDI-School/html-css-munich-2019-spring)
- click on the **Fork** icon on the top-right corner

This process will make a copy of the shared code for the class to your personal account. \
Once it is done, you should be able to see it in your Github for Desktop.

To be able to complete the homework, try to search on Google how to do perform the required steps. \
Don't worry if it looks complicated, we will repeat it during the next lesson.

Have fun üéâ
